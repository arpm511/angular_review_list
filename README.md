#  Reading List

This app is a sample code of what you can do with angularJS, a powerful javascript framework, that is used to develop client-side apps.
The reading list itself, lets you read, create and edit reviews for books you've read or intend to read.


## Getting Started
To get you started you can simply clone the AngularJSSTB repository and install the dependencies:

### Prerequisites

You need git to clone the repository. You can get it by:
`git clone https://github.com/arpm511/angular_reading_list.git

You must have node.js and its package manager (npm) installed.  You can get them from [http://nodejs.org/](http://nodejs.org/).


### Install Dependencies

There are two dependencies in this project: angular framework code and some of its packages. 

* We get the code we depend upon via `npm`, the [node package manager][npm].

I have preconfigured `npm` to automatically install all the dependencies for this project so you can simply do:

```
npm install
```

### Run the Application

This project is preconfigured with a simple development web server.  The simplest way to start
this server is:

```
npm start
```

Now browse to the app at `http://localhost:8000/app/index.html`.
